# Network-Monitoring
This Python project analyzes network traffic, showing stats like connections, packet size, and unique IPs/MACs. It uses Scapy and matplotlib to visualize throughput, latency, and protocol usage with graphs every 30 seconds. A TCP server-client model supports multiple connections, running continuously until terminated.
